Substrate is a Software Development Kit (SDK) that uses Rust-based libraries and tools to enable you to build application-specific blockchains from modular and extensible components.
The topics in this section explain many of the core principles and unique features of the Substrate development environment.

These topics are intended to help you learn what's possible when you build a Substrate-based blockchain and how Substrate can help you build a blockchain that best serves your specific project requirements or business model.

## [Basic](./basic/README.md)

This section will covers fundamental concepts of blockchain (e.g., network, accounts, cryptography) and basic knowledge about Substrate.

## [FRAME](./frame/README.md)

This section will cover overall content related to Substrate FRAME.

## [Runtime Development](./runtime-development/README.md)

This section will cover concepts needed when developing a runtime using Substrate.

## [Command Line Interface (CLI)](./command-line-tools/README.md)

This section will cover overall content about the Substrate CLI.
