In this tutorial, we will explore how to build the ***InfraRelayChain*** and Parachain and understand the process of constructing the multi-chain architecture, InfraBlockchain.

- [Building Relay Chain](./build-infra-relay-chain.md): Learn how to construct the central part of ***InfraBlockchain***, the ***InfraRelayChain***.

- [Building a Parachain](./build-a-parachain.md): Explore how to connect a blockchain based on the Cumulus framework to the InfraRelayChain.

- [Opening Message Passing Channels](./open-message-passing-channels.md): Understand the process of opening channels to enable Cross-Consensus Messages (XCM) between parachains.

- [Transferring Assets Using XCM](./transfer-assets-with-xcm.md): Learn how to transfer assets between different chains using XCM.
