In this tutorial, we will explore how to build the **_InfraRelayChain_** and Parachain and understand the process of constructing the multi-chain architecture, InfraBlockchain.

- [Build InfraRelayChain](./build-infra-relay-chain.md): Learn how to construct the central part of **_InfraBlockchain_**, the **_InfraRelayChain_**.

- [Build Parachain](./build-parachain.md): Explore how to connect a blockchain based on the Cumulus framework to the **_InfraRelayChain_**.

- [Opening Message Passing Channels](./open-message-passing-channels.md): Understand the process of opening channels to enable **Cross-Consensus Messages(XCM)** between parachains.

- [Transferring Assets Using XCM](./transfer-assets-with-xcm.md): Learn how to transfer assets between different chains using XCM.
